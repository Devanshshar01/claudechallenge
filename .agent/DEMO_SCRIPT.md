## 📊 Handling Questions

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: "How do you make money?"**
**A:** "Premium subscriptions for advanced features. Users pay for value, not with their data. Think: unlimited history, advanced analytics, custom categories - things people want, not exploitation."

**Q: "What if I want to use it on multiple devices?"**
**A:** "Great question! You can export your data and import it on another device. Future: peer-to-peer sync between YOUR devices only, never through our servers."

**Q: "How accurate is the AI?"**
**A:** "85%+ accuracy, comparable to cloud solutions. We use a custom NLP engine trained on emotion datasets. The model is lightweight but effective."

**Q: "Isn't cloud backup a good thing?"**
**A:** "Absolutely - for photos, documents. But mental health data is different. We give you export tools so YOU can back up to YOUR cloud if you want. We just don't touch it."

**Q: "What about sharing entries with a therapist?"**
**A:** "Export as PDF, send via your preferred method. Therapist never needs our app, you maintain control."

**Q: "Can you really sustain this without data?"**
**A:** "Yes! No servers = lower costs. Premium features customers actually want = revenue. Mental health apps are a $4B market. Privacy-conscious subset will pay."

**Q: "What stops someone from copying your code?"**
**A:** "Nothing - it's open source! But trust is our moat. We're first, we're genuine, we build reputation. Plus, our brand stands for something."

**Q: "What about HIPAA compliance?"**
**A:** "Technically yes since we never touch PHI. For formal clinical use, we'd get certification, but architecture is already compliant."

### Difficult Questions

**Q: "This sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?"**
**A:** "No catch. Just a different business model. Most apps are free because YOU are the product. We're building a product people pay for. Privacy is the feature AND the business model."

**Q: "Why should I trust you over [big company]?"**
**A:** "You shouldn't trust US - trust the code. Open source, auditable, verifiable. Even better: airplane mode test proves it mathematically. Turn off internet, it still works. That's not trust - that's proof."

**Q: "What if you get acquired?"**
**A:** "Great question. That's why open source matters. Even if company changes hands, the code can't. Community can fork it. But honestly, privacy IS our value. Acquisition would destroy that. Bad business."

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Mid-Demo

### If App Crashes:
**DON'T PANIC**

**SAY:**
> "And here's the beautiful thing - even crashes don't leak data! But let me restart... [reopen app] ...and see, everything's still here, still local."

**TURN IT INTO A FEATURE:**
- "Perfect opportunity to show data persistence"
- "Notice I didn't lose anything"
- "All still encrypted on-device"

### If Analysis is Slow:
**FILL THE TIME:**
> "Now while this processes - and remember, this is doing natural language processing entirely on this device - let me emphasize: most apps would send this to a server. Not us. This slight wait is your privacy guarantee."

### If Device Freezes:
**HAVE BACKUP READY:**
- Switch to backup device
- "Let me use this other device"
- "Great chance to show it works everywhere"

### If Internet Already Off:
**ADJUST SCRIPT:**
- "Notice we're already offline"
- "Let me TURN ON internet to prove I'm not cheating"
- [Turn on internet]
- "Still no network calls. Check your network inspector!"
