## Slide 2: The Problem 😰

### Mental Health Apps Have a Privacy Crisis

**76% of mental health app users** are concerned about data privacy
*(Source: Mozilla Foundation, 2023)*

#### Current Solutions Fail Users:
- 🔓 **Sensitive data on corporate servers**
- 📡 **Emotions mined for advertising**
- 🌐 **Requires internet connection**
- 💰 **Monetized through data selling**
- 🔍 **No transparency on data access**

#### Real Consequences:
- Insurance discrimination
- Employment screening
- Advertising manipulation
- Government surveillance
- Data breaches exposing innermost thoughts

**Quote:** *"Sharing your mental health data shouldn't require trusting a corporation."*

## Appendix: Common Questions

### Q&A Preparation

**Q: How do you make money if no ads/data?**
A: Premium subscriptions for advanced features. Users pay for value, not with their data.

**Q: What if users want cloud backup?**
A: They can export and backup to their own cloud (iCloud, Google Drive). We just don't touch it.

**Q: How accurate is on-device AI vs cloud?**
A: 85%+ accuracy, comparable to cloud solutions. Lightweight models trained on emotion datasets.

**Q: What about scalability?**
A: No servers = infinite scalability. Each device is its own server.

**Q: Open source means copycats?**
A: Trust is our moat. Plus, first-mover advantage and brand reputation.

**Q: HIPAA compliance?**
A: Technically yes, since we never handle PHI. But we'd need formal certification for clinical use.

## Demo Troubleshooting

### If Things Go Wrong:

**App crashes:**
- Have backup device ready
- Screen recording as fallback
- Emphasize: "Even crashes stay local!"

**Slow performance:**
- Restart app
- Clear demo data
- Use fresh install

**Questions you can't answer:**
- "Great question! Let's discuss after."
- "That's on our roadmap!"
- "I'll send you detailed info."

**Confidence builders:**
- Show source code
- Demonstrate offline mode
- Export and inspect data file
- Network inspector (0 requests)
